          A German knife is a tool built for durability — thick spine, soft steel (HRC 56–58), a rolled edge that can be reset with a honing steel. It will survive a decade in a professional kitchen without much care. A Japanese knife is something different: a precision instrument optimized for sharpness first, longevity second. The blades are thinner, the steel harder (HRC 60–68), and the geometry more acute — typically 10–15° per side vs. 20–25° for European knives. Food slides off differently. The cut feels different. But the demands are different too.

It is fully stainless with excellent corrosion resistance. For users who want the sharpening feel and edge quality of carbon steel without reactivity, AEB-L is widely considered the best answer. It won't hold an edge as long as powders or high-carbon steels, but it touches up in minutes.",
